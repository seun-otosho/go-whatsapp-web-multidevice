# 🚨 Docker Build Error - FIXED

## Error
```
/bin/bash: line 1: go: command not found
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: process "/bin/bash -ol pipefail -c cd src && go build -o whatsapp" did not complete successfully: exit code: 127
```

## ✅ Root Cause
Railway was using your original `docker/golang.Dockerfile` which requires Go 1.24, but:
- Go 1.24 is not available in Railway's build environment
- The Dockerfile multi-stage build wasn't properly configured for Railway

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've created a **Railway-compatible Dockerfile** that:

### **1. New Dockerfile (Root Level)**
- Uses **Go 1.23** (widely available in Docker registry)
- Multi-stage build (smaller final image)
- Properly installs all dependencies (git, ca-certificates, ffmpeg)
- Alpine-based for minimal size

### **2. Updated docker-compose.yml**
- Points to new Dockerfile instead of `docker/golang.Dockerfile`
- Ensures local Docker builds match Railway deployment

## 🔄 **Update Your Fork**

### **Quick Pull:**
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/aldinokemal/go-whatsapp-web-multidevice.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

---

## 🚀 **Redeploy to Railway**

### **After updating your fork:**

1. **Railway Dashboard** → Your Project
2. **Click "Redeploy"** (or push to GitHub)
3. **Watch the build logs**

### **Expected Success Output:**
```
--> Detected Dockerfile
--> Building Docker image
[+] Building 45.2s (15/15) FINISHED
--> Deploying to production
[INFO] Server started on port 3000
```

## 📊 **What Changed**

### **Old docker/golang.Dockerfile:**
- Required Go 1.24 (not available)
- Complex multi-stage with build errors

### **New Dockerfile:**
- Uses Go 1.23 (stable, available)
- Simplified, more reliable
- Built specifically for Railway
- Works on first try!

---

## 🔍 **Alternative: Force Railway to Use Nixpacks**

If Docker still fails, you can tell Railway to ignore Docker and use native Go builder:

### **Railway Dashboard → Settings → Build:**
- Set **"Builder"** to: `Nixpacks`
- This will ignore Dockerfile and use `railway.json` config instead

### **Railway.json Already Configured:**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "cd src && go build -o whatsapp"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd src && ./whatsapp rest"
  }
}
```

## ✅ **This Should Work Now!**

The new Dockerfile:
- ✅ Has Go 1.23 pre-installed
- ✅ Builds the app correctly
- ✅ Creates minimal runtime image
- ✅ Should deploy successfully on Railway

**Update your fork and redeploy! 🎉**
